Description:   Chicken is an implementation of the Scheme language. It is portable, efficient, and supports 
  the R5RS and R7RS (work in progress) standards, and many extensions.
  Chicken can be used as a scripting language to automate tasks.
  This package contains the interpreter, 'csi', only --
  the compiler and the package installer are not included because they depend on a C compiler.
  For more information, please refer to the Chicken Scheme website at https://call-cc.org.

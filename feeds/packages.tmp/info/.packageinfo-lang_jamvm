Description:  JamVM is a Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
 specification version 2 (a.k.a, 1.2).  In comparison to most other VM's (free
 and commercial) it is extremely small.  However, unlike other small VMs
 (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and includes
 support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java
 Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.

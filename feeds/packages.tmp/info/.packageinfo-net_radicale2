Title: Radicale 2.x CalDAV/CardDAV server
Maintainer: Daniel Dickinson <cshored@thecshore.com>

LicenseFiles: COPYING
Type: ipkg
Description: The Radicale Project is a CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact) server. It aims to be a light solution, easy to use, easy to install, easy to configure. As a consequence, it requires few software dependances and is pre-configured to work out-of-the-box.

The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD, MacOS X) and Windows. It is known to work with Evolution, Lightning, iPhone and Android clients. It is free and open-source software, released under GPL version 3.

This package contains the python files.

Note that md5 encryption of passwords requires passlib, and
bcrypt encryption requires passlib + bcrypt.  These are not
added as hard dependencies as users may be running radicale2
with a web server doing the authentication instead of radicale2.
